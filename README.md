# Uria-Bonen-25.10.2020

The Test Plan and Test case documents are in a separate file because they include matrix.

About The Automation Tests:
I wrote Automation Tests for most of the main scenarios according to my discretion and within the time I had.
because i write the automation test in java - i use it in Maven to package all the tests and i upload it to my gitHub.  
I write the tests according to Page Object Model (Design Pattern) so as you will see the tests divided to 2 parts:
Under test/java folder (you can ignore from main/java/Pages/AutomationAssignment_UriaBonen folder)
package #1 (Pages AutomationAssignment_UriaBonen): contain all the functionality, paths of elements, conditions , synchronize etc.
package #2 (TestCases) contain all the Test Cases.
Thank you.
